In Teams we can save (or bookmark) chat conversations, mentions, and other type of notifications so we can respond to them in a more convenient time.

So, how do we bookmark a message to respond to it later?

In a message, just click on the bookmark icon.

Now we have saved that message. And now itâ€™s a more convenient time to respond to that message so we need to find it.

In the Search Bar, type **/saved** and then press the Enter key.

Now we will see all of our Bookmarked/Saved conversations.
